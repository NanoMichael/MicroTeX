The XITS font project
======================

XITS is a Times-like typeface for mathematical and scientific publishing, based
on [STIX fonts][1]. The main mission of XITS is to provide a version of STIX
fonts enhanced with the OpenType `MATH` table, making it suitable for high
quality mathematic typesetting with OpenType math-capable layout systems, like
Microsoft Office 2007+, XeTeX and LuaTeX.

XITS fonts are distributed under the [Open Font License][2], version 1.1.
